# Arithmetic_arranger
The program helps to rearrange arithmetic problems from horizontal format to a vertical format
to make it easy for children to solve.
e.g a set of numbers written in this form: "32 + 698", "3801 - 2", "45 + 43", "123 + 49"
will be formatted to come out in this format below:

   32      3801      45      123
+ 698    -    2    + 43    +  49
-----    ------    ----    -----
